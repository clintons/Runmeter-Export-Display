Runmeter is an iPhone app useful for GPS tracking of time and distance exercise and as such does a fine job eclipsing some of the other variants. Runmeter App features the ability to export and share your (KML,GPX,CSV) data via email or link. Although Runmeter has excellent data analysis menu choices on the iPhone itself and can recall and layout event history; the Runmeter does not have a co-branded display and summary website. However, it is possible to mirror your events and statistics on a personal web page. Using the Runmeter export feature you might try uploading a GPX file to Everytrail or Trailguru. I prefer to roll my own and this code project is working succesfully. Please feel free to improve and enhance. CS
